# "Minimalistic" .vimrc

I'm not a big fan of lots of plugins for a number of reasons that I won't get into. This is subject to change -- a lot of change. I try to not use plugins whenever possible, that means my hacky solutions might sometimes not work in 100% of edge cases.

**statusbar.vim** is currently unused. I designed the statusbar a while ago while I was working on bigger code bases where it was beneficial to see SCM info etc. I've since reconsidered my opinion on bloated status bars and have gone for a more simplistic looking statusbar included in the .vimrc .

A lot of language specific stuff happens in .vim/after/ftplugin directories, I have not shared that.
